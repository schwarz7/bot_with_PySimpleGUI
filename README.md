# bot_with_PySimpleGUI
using PySimpleGUI library to build a bot for games

Used the PySimpleGUI to build the layout, then configured button actions using pyautogui for clicks and keyboard library for keyboard events.
Unfortunatly needs admin privilege to run over linux, but was the only way I found to send keys even when the window isn't active.
